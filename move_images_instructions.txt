To move your images into the correct folders for your design projects, do the following:

1. Move all files starting with 'vol55-2-' (e.g., vol55-2-01.jpg, vol55-2-02.jpg, etc.) into:
   design-popup/vol55-2/

2. Move all files starting with 'vol56-1-' (e.g., vol56-1-01.jpg, etc.) into:
   design-popup/vol56-1/

3. Move all files starting with 'vol56-2-' (e.g., vol56-2-01.jpg, etc.) into:
   design-popup/vol56-2/

4. Move all files starting with 'vol57-1-' (if any) into:
   design-popup/vol57-1/

5. Move all files starting with 'lines (' (e.g., lines (1).JPG, etc.) into:
   design-popup/lines/

6. Move all files starting with 'x-journal-' (if any) into:
   design-popup/x-journal/

After moving, update your code to look for images in these folders. If you want, I can update your code to use the new folder structure automatically.
