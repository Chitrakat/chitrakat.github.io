          For the first time in recent editions, the magazine was produced at a larger, traditional magazine scale. This change in size was intentional, allowing the publication to feel more confident as an object. The increased format created space for images to breathe, text to expand, and graphics to be used across pages rather than being compressed into smaller, plain layouts.

          The thematic focus of the issue centers on the scanner as both a tool and a conceptual framework. Scanners were used to capture a wide range of objects and images, emphasizing flattening, distortion, and accidental detail. The scanning process introduced artifacts such as shadows, edges, and compression, which became integral to the visual language of the magazine rather than elements to be corrected.

          This approach extends to the cover design. The back covers draw directly from the artworks featured inside the issue, edited and recontextualized to reflect the internal vibrancy of the magazine. The front cover features a tree silhouette sourced from the Knox College campus, grounding the publication in a specific place.

          <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The table of contents continues this site-specific approach. The flowers used throughout this section were scanned from the cushions inside the Pub Office, a shared space where editorial meetings and collaborations took place.
