        <p>
          For Volume 56, Number 2, <em>Catch</em> underwent another dramatic shift in both form and production. Rather than refining an existing format, the editorial and design team chose to dismantle it entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          This edition was produced as a spineless, unbound collection of pages. Freed from traditional binding, the magazine exists as a loose set of printed works that emphasize circulation and movement. Pages can be reordered, shared, or separated, allowing readers to engage with the content in a non-linear and participatory way.
        </p>

        <p>
          The scale of the publication was reduced to a postcard format. Images function explicitly as postcards, printed on thicker stock to reinforce their material presence. This shift reframes the magazine as something that can be mailed, collected, or exchanged, extending the life of the work beyond reading and into everyday interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          The visual identity of the issue was developed through a close collaboration with artist Kevin Dera, who created the drawings and artwork used for the front cover. His illustrations establish the tone of the edition while remaining in dialogue with the experimental format, reinforcing the idea of the magazine as a distributed and collaborative object rather than a fixed volume.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, the issue challenges conventional ideas of what a magazine can be, foregrounding material experimentation, collaboration, and reader agency as central elements of the design.
