        <p>Lines in the Shed is a poetry book designed for writer and scholar Ryan Tracy, whose work explores social fracture, environmental anxiety, intimacy, and queer identity within contemporary American life.</p>
        
        <h3>Design Concept</h3>
        <p>The design is built around the image of a shed in a state of decay. Rather than treating the shed as a stable or orderly structure, it is presented as something broken, overgrown, and eroded. This damaged environment reflects the emotional and social landscapes of the poems.</p>
        
        <h3>Color & Material</h3>
        <p>The color of the book responds directly to recurring imagery in the text, including references to radiation, artificial light, and environmental contamination, as well as organic elements such as moss.</p>
        
        <h3>Typography & Identity</h3>
        <p>Typography plays a central conceptual role. The title treatment is inspired by label maker tape, a utilitarian material used to mark tools and objects in a shed. The type grounds the book in a traditionally masculine space while reframing that space as a private site for drag, self-expression, and transformation. In this context, a system meant for categorization becomes a marker of identity.</p>
