        <p><em>Lines in the Shed</em> is a poetry book designed for writer and scholar Ryan Tracy, whose work navigates social fracture, environmental anxiety, intimacy, and queer identity within contemporary American life.</p>
        
        <h4>Design Concept</h4>
        <p>The book's <span style="color: #00ff00;">neon color palette</span> responds directly to recurring imagery within the poems, including references to radiation, artificial light, contamination, and environmental anxiety—the uneasy glow of crisis embedded in the everyday.</p>
        
        <h4>Typography & Layout</h4>
        <p>The title treatment is inspired by <strong>label-maker tape</strong>, a utilitarian material commonly used to mark tools and objects in a shed. This reference aligns with the book's core tension: the shed as a traditionally masculine space, reimagined as a private site for drag, self-expression, and transformation.</p>
