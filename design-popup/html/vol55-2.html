        <em>Catch</em> is an undergraduate literary magazine published by Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. Established in 1922 and officially named <em>Catch</em> in 1969, it is the oldest continuously published undergraduate literary journal in the United States. The magazine is funded by Knox College and run entirely by a student-led collective, publishing undergraduate fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, drama, music, and visual art.

      <h4> Behind the design </h4>
      <p>
        For Volume 55, Number 2, the editorial staff selected a theme inspired by a specific method of printing: risograph. While the magazine did not have the budget to produce a true risograph-printed edition, the design approach focused on translating the visual language of risograph printing into a digital and offset format.
      </p>

      <p>
        The visual system draws from risograph characteristics such as rough texture, visible layering, limited color palettes, and imperfect registration. These qualities were reinterpreted through bold typography, experimental layouts, and intentional irregularities that challenge the cleanliness of traditional magazine design. The goal was not to simulate risograph printing exactly, but to capture its material energy and sense of process within the constraints of student production.
      </p>

      <h4> Custom stickers</h4>
      <p>
        In addition to the magazine layout, a series of custom stickers was designed as part of the issue visual identity. Given full creative freedom, the sticker designs were kept minimal and conceptually tied to the division of content within the magazine. Each sticker functions as a modular extension of the publication, reinforcing the theme while remaining accessible and playful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, the issue reflects the collaborative nature of <em>Catch</em> and the realities of student-led publishing, embracing experimentation, limitation, and collective authorship as core elements of the design.
