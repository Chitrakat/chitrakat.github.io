  <h1 class="project-title">Interactive p5.js Animations for X-Journal</h1>

  <p class="project-description">
    I created a series of interactive p5.js animations for X-Journal, a contemporary student-run publication at Knox College. The goal of this project was to design visually striking, motion-driven promotional material that would increase student engagement and encourage more creative submissions.

Using p5.js, I developed dynamic generative animations that reflect the magazine’s experimental and modern identity. These visuals were optimized for digital distribution and embedded media, making them suitable for use on social platforms, mailing lists, and the X-Journal website. The animations were intentionally minimalist, leveraging motion, rhythm, and color to capture attention without relying on traditional graphic design layouts.

This project demonstrates my ability to merge creative coding, interactive design, and visual communication in a way that supports real-world student-driven publications.
