    <p>As an international student in the US, I can't help but feel something unsettling about the American life. 
      <br>      
      Americans themselves seem unable to recognize what their country has become, perhaps it is more difficult to accept that America has always been this way.</p>
    
    <p>The great American dream has been dead, and in place, I find empty spaces, hollow institutions and overconsumption.</p>
    <p>Photographs taken during my travels across the United States.</p>
